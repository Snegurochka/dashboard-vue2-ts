# Seller Dashboard

## Technologies used: 

### Firebase REST API.
All the requests to the REST endpoints are stored in the API.ts file.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database

### Vue 2 and Vuex.
I love working with this framework because it is very easy to use and really efficient for getting things done.
Store is divided into modules: products, user, notifications.

### TypeScript. JS for Components.
I think that the use of TypeScript in the parts working with data is vitally important. 
So I used TypeScript in Vuex, Routers and API.
